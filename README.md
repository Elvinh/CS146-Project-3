# CS146-Project-3

Your README.txt file needs to answer the following questions:
1. Who is in your group?
2. How long did the project take?
3. Before you started, which data structure did you expect would be the fastest?
4. Which data structure is the fastest? Why were you right or wrong?
5. In general, which DataCounter dictionary implementation was "better": trees or hash
tables? Note that you will need to define "better" (ease of coding, ease of debugging,
memory usage, disk access patterns, runtime for average input, runtime for all input, etc).
6. Are there cases in which a particular data structure performs really well or badly in the
correlator? Enumerate the cases for each data structure.
7. Give a one to two paragraph explanation of whether or not you think Bacon wrote
Shakespeare's plays based on the data you collected. No fancy statistical analysis here
(formal analysis comes later); keep it fun and simple.
8. Writeup your benchmarks (this is long). Your mission is to convince us that your
benchmark makes sense and that we should be interested in it if we are trying to
ascertain which data structure is better suited for your input. You will need to answer at
least the following (all formal analysis should answer something similar):
• What are you measuring?
• What is the definition of "better" given your measurement?
• Why is the measurement interesting in determining which is the superior algorithm for this
project?
• What was your method of benchmarking?
• What were the sources of errors?
• What were your results?
• How did you interpret your results?
• What were your conclusions?
• Are there any interesting directions for future study?
You may attach this in a separate, non-plain-text file. If you do use a non-plaintext format
please ensure that the file extension matches the format. Also, please consider using
PDFs in place of proprietary formats (i.e .doc(x), .xls(x), .pages, .numbers, etc.) which will
just cause your grader extra headaches.
9. What did you enjoy about this assignment? What did you hate? Could we have done
anything better?
